# Knock Knock, Shippers! 🏘️

A gamified team management and weekly task reporting system that transforms boring status updates into an engaging neighborhood experience.

## 🎮 Game Overview

"Knock Knock, Shippers!" is an innovative approach to team coordination where traditional weekly reporting becomes an immersive pixel-art game. Team members live in a virtual neighborhood, each with their own house and activity board, creating transparency and engagement around weekly accomplishments.

### Key Features

- **📊 Team Analytics**: View team performance through the Town Hall leaderboard
- **💬 Peer Interaction**: Comment and react to teammates' accomplishments
- **🎨 Professional Pixel Art**: High-quality retro aesthetic with smooth animations

## 🎯 How It Works
