# Product Requirements Document: Knock Knock, Shippers! (MVP)

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of "Knock Knock, Shippers!", a gamified weekly task reporting system designed for Digital Transformation teams. The game transforms traditional "what did you get done this week" reporting into an engaging, transparent neighborhood experience where team members maintain virtual homes with announcement boards displaying their weekly accomplishments.

**Problem Statement:** Traditional weekly task reporting lacks engagement and transparency, often resulting in generic updates that don't showcase the true value and effort of team members' work.

**Goal:** Create a focused MVP that delivers core gamified task reporting with professional pixel art design, establishing foundation for future monetization and feature expansion.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal (MVP):** Deliver a polished, engaging weekly task reporting system with professional pixel art design.
- **Secondary Goal:** Implement a streamlined neighborhood creation and invitation system with team lead approval workflow.
- **Tertiary Goal:** Establish a technical foundation (Supabase integration, scalable architecture) for future paid expansion features.

- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for managing application state
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Build Tool:** Vite for development and bundling
- **Asset Management:** Game assets served from public directory
- **Backend:** Supabase for authentication, database, and real-time features

### Database Design
**Core Tables:**
- neighborhoods (id, code, name, created_by, created_at)
- users (id, email, name, avatar, created_at)
- team_members (id, neighborhood_id, user_id, role, status, house_position)
- tasks (id, user_id, week_start, description, category, project_milestone, priority, points, created_at)
- join_requests (id, neighborhood_id, user_id, status, requested_at)
- **[MUST HAVE - MVP]** badges (id, user_id, badge_type, earned_at, badge_data)
- **[MUST HAVE - MVP]** task_interactions (id, task_id, user_id, interaction_type, content, created_at)
